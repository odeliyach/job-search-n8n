# Troubleshooting

Real bugs hit during development — and how they were fixed.

---

## GitHub API returns 422 on file update

**Symptom:** Commit node fails with `422 Unprocessable Entity` when trying to update an existing file.

**Cause:** GitHub's API requires the current file `sha` when overwriting an existing file. Without it, the API assumes you're trying to create a file that already exists.

**Fix:** Add a `GET` request before every `PUT` to fetch the current sha:
```js
// GET the file first
const fileResp = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/.../contents/' + path, ...);
const sha = fileResp.json().sha || undefined;

// Then PUT with sha
body: { message, content, sha }  // sha || undefined creates on first run, updates on subsequent
```

## n8n `$input.all()` with positional indexing breaks on merge nodes

**Symptom:** `$input.all()[0]` returns unexpected data or throws after a Merge node.

**Cause:** n8n's merge node passes items from multiple upstream nodes. Positional indexing assumes a specific order that isn't guaranteed.

**Fix:** Always read upstream nodes by name:
```js
// Wrong
const tier1 = $input.all()[0].json;

// Correct
const tier1 = $('Tier 1 - Core Application').first().json;
```

## Groq rate limit: 6000 TPM exceeded

**Symptom:** `The service is receiving too many requests` on T2, T3, or T4 nodes.

**Cause:** Multiple Groq calls fired back-to-back exhaust the 6000 tokens-per-minute limit.

**Fix:** Add 30-second Wait nodes between consecutive Groq calls. The follow-up scheduler also splits by follow-up type across 4 triggers (9:00/9:30/10:00/10:30) so each run only processes ~5 items instead of 20+.

## CORS error when calling webhook from local file

**Symptom:** `Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy` when opening `index.html` via `file://`.

**Cause:** Browsers block cross-origin requests from `file://` origins. n8n's default config doesn't include CORS headers.

**Fix 1:** Add `N8N_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` to `docker-compose.yml` environment.  
**Fix 2:** Serve the HTML via a local server (VS Code Live Server, `python -m http.server`).

---

## n8n Webhook node rejects request: "responseMode is not valid"

**Symptom:** Webhook returns `{"code":0,"message":"The response mode 'immediatelyAfter' is not valid!"}`.

**Cause:** `immediatelyAfter` is not a valid `responseMode` value in this version of n8n.

**Fix:** Remove the `responseMode` parameter entirely from the Webhook node — n8n uses `lastNode` by default.

---

## `$('Job Form')` throws when triggered via webhook

**Symptom:** `Cannot assign to read only property 'name' of object 'Error: Node 'Job Form' hasn't been executed'`

**Cause:** Code node references `$('Job Form')` as a fallback, but n8n throws (not returns null) when referencing a node that didn't run in this execution path.

**Fix:** Remove the `|| $('Job Form').first().json['Job Description']` fallback. The `Job Input` Set node normalizes field names from both trigger sources — downstream nodes only need to read `$('Job Input')`.

---

## Follow-up scheduler generates all types instead of filtering

**Symptom:** Scheduler sends day_3, day_7, day_30, and day_90 emails for every company instead of just today's type.

**Cause:** `Parse Follow-Up Dates` had a `// TEMP TEST` comment that bypassed the `=== today` date filter.

**Fix:** Restore the date filter. Add time-based type filter:
```js
const now = new Date();
const hour = now.getHours();
const minute = now.getMinutes();
let typeFilter = null;
if (hour === 9 && minute < 30)  typeFilter = 'day_3';
else if (hour === 9)             typeFilter = 'day_7';
else if (hour === 10 && minute < 30) typeFilter = 'day_30';
else if (hour === 10)            typeFilter = 'day_90';
if (typeFilter) followupsNeeded = followupsNeeded.filter(f => f.followup_type === typeFilter);
```

## Gmail Auto-Labeler: false `REPLIED` on first recruiter outreach

**Symptom:** First email sent to a recruiter gets labeled `REPLIED` instead of `WAITING FOR RESPONSE`.

**Cause:** The `isReply` detection was checking whether the thread already had a job-search label. Since the thread already had `FROM_RECRUITER` from an earlier incoming message, the outgoing first-contact email was misidentified as a reply to an existing thread.

**Fix:** Use subject `Re:` prefix only for `isReply` detection on outgoing emails:
```js
// Wrong — thread labels cause false positives
const isReply = threadHasJobLabel;

// Correct — only trust the subject prefix for outgoing emails
const isReply = subject.startsWith('re:');
```

## Gmail API: case-sensitive field names cause silent failures

**Symptom:** Email classification produces wrong results — `from`, `to`, `subject` fields read as empty even when the email has them.

**Cause:** Gmail API returns `From`, `To`, `Subject` with capital letters, and `labels` as an array of `{id, name}` objects — not `labelIds`. Code expecting lowercase keys or a flat `labelIds` array silently gets `undefined`.

**Fix:** Always use capital field names and map the labels array:
```js
const from = item.From || '';           // capital F
const to = item.To || '';               // capital T
const labelIds = (item.labels || []).map(l => l.id);  // not item.labelIds
```

---

## Gmail Auto-Labeler: switching to thread resource breaks downstream nodes

**Symptom:** Nodes after the Gmail node stop receiving data or throw ID-related errors after switching from message to thread fetch mode.

**Cause:** The Gmail node's thread resource returns a different ID format than the message resource. Downstream nodes (Clear All, Apply Label) were built expecting message IDs — thread IDs are not interchangeable.

**Fix:** Keep fetching by message, then deduplicate by `threadId` in the `Fix Logic` Code node. Run the node in "Run Once for All Items" mode so `$input.all()` has access to all messages for deduplication in a single pass:
```js
// Fix Logic node — mode: "Run Once for All Items"
const items = $input.all();
// group by threadId, keep newest message per thread
const byThread = {};
for (const item of items) {
  const tid = item.json.threadId;
  if (!byThread[tid] || item.json.internalDate > byThread[tid].json.internalDate) {
    byThread[tid] = item;
  }
}
```

## Email Listener: Gmail Trigger fires on emails sent to self (workflow notifications)

**Symptom:** n8n notification emails (sent from your address to your address) get classified as recruiter emails and trigger false notifications.

**Cause:** The Gmail Trigger had no filter to exclude self-sent emails.

**Fix:** Add `-from:your_email@gmail.com` to the Gmail Trigger filter query, and add an explicit check in the Classify Email node:
```js
if (fromEmail === MY_EMAIL && toEmail === MY_EMAIL) {
    return { label: ID_N8N, ... };
}
```

---

## `now is not defined` in Parse Follow-Up Dates

**Symptom:** `ReferenceError: now is not defined` at line where `now.getHours()` is called.

**Cause:** The time-based type filter code referenced `now` before declaring it. `today` was declared at the top of the node as a string (`new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`) but `now` as a Date object was never declared.

**Fix:**
```js
const now = new Date();   // add this line before the filter block
const hour = now.getHours();
const minute = now.getMinutes();
```

## Render free tier: wait nodes die and scheduled triggers miss their window

**Symptom:** Workflows using Wait nodes complete only the first part and then silently stop. Scheduled triggers (cron) don't fire at their expected time.

**Cause:** Render's free tier puts the container to sleep after ~15 minutes of inactivity. When it wakes up, n8n starts fresh with no execution state. Wait nodes work by saving execution state and resuming later — if the container sleeps between the pause and the resume, that state is gone. Scheduled triggers need a running process to fire — if the container is asleep at 9:00am, the trigger simply doesn't run.

**Why this matters for this project specifically:** The main workflow has 8+ wait nodes (30–60 seconds each) spread across the tier chain. The follow-up scheduler has 4 cron triggers. The Gmail labeler runs every 30 minutes. None of these work reliably on a free-tier host that sleeps.

**Fix:** Run n8n locally on Docker (`docker compose up -d`) so the process stays permanently alive as long as the machine is on. The tradeoff is the webhook is only accessible while your laptop is running — which is fine for personal use.

**Correct cloud fix (when needed):** Render paid tier, a DigitalOcean Droplet (~$6/month), or Railway — any host that keeps the container permanently alive without sleep periods.
